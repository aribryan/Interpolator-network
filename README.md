# Interpolator-network
A simple resolution independent  frame interpolator  
# Background info
This one is an indirect network implementation of 3d Voxel flow paper (google it!). I removed the trilinear sampler and added SSIM, L1, L2 losses and the interpolation works fine. I will upload more results later.
Additional stuff : The networks.py also stores some of the used network functions. Any addition is welcome. I will add the running instructions later.
